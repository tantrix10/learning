Assorted long term learing projects notes/code

I am also trying to use this longer form notes repo as a way to slow down a little. I have a tendency to learn things quickly through little learning projects that leads to specific knowledge in one area, but large gaps from the lack of formal learning. This is an attempt to address that imbalance.
