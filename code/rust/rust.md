## Current Rust learning plan.

    1. Go through educative rust course to actually have a full education in a language for once.
       * This is also a test to see how well courses suit me, I have historically learnt on the go with a problem in mind, a bit of an experiment.   
    2. Implement Sudoku generator and solver.
    3. Go through implement tcp in rust https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzja9fQWzdA . 
    4. Re-start c++ chess rules engine and play engine in rust.
